# Music Generator 
This is a program that can take in a note letter and an octave and output the corresponding sound.

## TODO:
* Add note parsing.
* Add sound output (through a file.)
  * Make it so that it can actually play the sound.


## Maybe TODO?
* Add capability to read from a file of notes
  * Maybe even MIDI?
    * That might be too different from our input.
